# Snake-Game-solver
Snake game is classic single player grid-based game. The objective of this game is to grow snake 
as long as possible by guiding it in the direction of apple. The player will move the snake in the 
direction of apple and each time snake will eat apple, it will grow a unit longer. If snake collides 
with its own body or grid, the game will be terminated.
This has been implemented by using Breath first search, A* and combination of forward checking and BFS method.
